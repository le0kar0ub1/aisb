#W3D5 - Hardware Security & LLM Applications (MCP, RAG)

Today, we'll extend yesterday's exercises with a quick exercise on physical security until lunch. Then, we'll look at MCP (Model Context Protocol) and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems.

## Exercise 1: Hardware Supply Chain Security

### Exercise 1.1: Reading and Discussion
Start by reading:
- https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/2019/can-we-build-trustable-hardware/
- (stretch) https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/2019/supply-chain-security-talk/
- https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevebanker/2023/02/17/the-worlds-most-vulnerable-supply-chain-impacts-all-supply-chains/
- https://www.ft.com/content/c02fbf55-ae33-427b-8302-56529f9d5719

Then, discuss with the following prompts:
1. What are the main bottlenecks in the supply chain for AI accelerators?
2. How could an adversary exploit these bottlenecks?
3. What has been the effect of the export controls? Now that they have been lifted, what do you expect to see? Were the expert controls a good idea?

### Exercise 1.2

Ask a TA for this exercise!



## Exercise 2: Model Context Protocol (MCP)

### Exercise 2.1: Writing a MCP Client

Let's start by implementing a simple MCP client that can connect to our MCP server at `https://0.mcp.aisb.dev`.

The documentation for MCP can be found at https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/
A couple of useful links:
- https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/transports#streamable-http
- https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/lifecycle

I recommend you do these in this order:
1. implement connect()
2. implement send_message() and get_message() methods to send and receive messages from the MCP server.
3. implement the handshake() method to initialize the connection with the MCP server.
4. implement get_resources() and get_tools() methods to list resources and tools available on the MCP server.
5. implement access_resource() method to access a specific resource by its URI.
6. implement access_tool() method to access a specific tool by its URI.

Using this, you can access the MCP servers and run custom commands to exploit the resources and tools available on the server.



```python

class MCPClient:
    def __init__(self, url_base):
        self.url_base = url_base

        self.messages = []
        self.server_info = None

    def connect(self):
        """
        Connect to the MCP server and listen for messages.
        This method uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) to receive real-time updates from the MCP server.

        self.endpoint will be set to the endpoint URL provided by the MCP server.

        #   - Store the endpoint URL in self.endpoint and push the messages to self.messages
        #   - Have a lower bar for looking at the solution for this one if you don't know how http streaming works
        pass

    def send_message(self, message):

        # todo: implement the handshake with the MCP server
        #   - Send an initialization message to the MCP server with the protocol version and client info.
        #   - Wait for the server's response and store it in self.server_info
        pass

    def get_resources(self, cursor=None):
        """
        Get resources from the MCP server.
        :param cursor: Optional cursor for pagination.
        :return: List of resources.

        """
        # todo: implement the logic to list tools on the MCP server

    def access_resource(self, resource_uri):

        :param resource_uri: The URI of the resource to access.

        """
        # todo: implement the logic to access a resource by its URI
        pass


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example usage
    mcp_client = MCPClient("https://0.mcp.aisb.dev")
    thread = threading.Thread(target=mcp_client.connect, daemon=True).start()
    while not mcp_client.endpoint:
        time.sleep(0.1)
        print(".", end="")
    mcp_client.handshake()
```


### Exercise 2.1b: All the servers!

Once you have the flag for exercise 0, you can move to getting the flag for exercise 1 & 2. (https://1.mcp.aisb.dev and https://2.mcp.aisb.dev). These servers have more complex resources and tools that you can use to get the flag.

Continue updating your code to implement any remaining methods required to complete the CTF.

After completing exercise 1 & 2:
- You can move to exercise 2.2 and work on servers 0-2 using cline, then come back to this section for the remaining servers.
- Or, you can move to the next set of servers (https://3.mcp.aisb.dev thru https://9.mcp.aisb.dev)

### Exercise 2.2: Using Cline to interact with the MCP servers

Install (cline)[https://docs.cline.bot/getting-started/what-is-cline], which is a vscode extension that allows you to interact with MCP servers directly from your editor.

Once you have installed cline, you can use the following configuration to connect to the MCP server:

After this, you can try each challenge by trying to prompt the model. Use claude 3.5 haiku for this.

### Exercise 2.3: Securing MCP

Start by reading https://blog.trailofbits.com/2025/07/28/we-built-the-security-layer-mcp-always-needed/

You can try one of these optional exercises to secure the MCP server:
1. Implement the features as described in the article.
2. Implement Oauth authentication for the MCP server - https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/authorization
